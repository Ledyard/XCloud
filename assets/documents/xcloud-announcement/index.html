    <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud" aria-hidden="true"></span> XCloud Extension 0.3.0 Release</h1>
    <p>Everyone rejoice, we have a new XCloud up and running!<br>
    (Hopefully it won't immediately buckle under the load...)
    </p>

    <h2>What this means to you.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>For users on new XKit and couldn't get XCloud to work</h3>
    <p>You can now use XCloud to backup and restore your user settings.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>For users on new XKit and was using XCloud perfectly fine</h3>
    <p>
        XCloud will still work for you.  After you update you still should be able to just keep using XCloud normally.<br>
        If XCloud stops working after the update, you may need to login again.<br><br>
        Just make sure you check "Use the old XCloud Servers" on the welcome page. to use the old XCloud servers.<br>

        <br>
        If you want to migrate to the new server you can logout of XCloud and register for a new account.<br>
        Then just sync and you're on the new XCloud.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>For users on old XKit who want to upgrade but cannot upgrade through the old XCloud</h3>
    <p>We have a <a href="https://portal.new-xkit.com/assets/migration/xcloud-migration.html">migration guide</a> which will use XCloud to store your information and then restore your settings after you upgrade to New-XKit.</p>
